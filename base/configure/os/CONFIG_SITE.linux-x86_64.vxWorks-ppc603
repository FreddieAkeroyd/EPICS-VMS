# Site override definitions for linux-x86_64 host - vxWorks-ppc603 target builds
#-------------------------------------------------------
# This file contains overrides for Vx builds
# ORNL SNS overrides for cross compilers

# The custom cross compiler for VxWorks on Linux
# has place in a directory structure like that of
# the Solaris distribution.  So now the cross should
# only need the following line.
# cross-compiler from "Linux x86pc" host to a "ppc603" target
