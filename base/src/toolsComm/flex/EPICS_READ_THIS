This is the regular GNU flex that has had its skeleton file munged with in
order to force it to build lex programs that have all their functions and 
variables defined as static.  

The file in Unix/share/bin/flex.skel.static is simply a copy of flex.skel that 
has been altered to make all the components into static variables.

In order to be able to actually use the lex files produced by this flavor of
flex, you must #include them into your C programs.  Otherwise they will
be uncallable (all functions are static.)  This is typical of lex programs
that are used by yacc programs anyway.

The file Unix/share/bin/flex.skel.static has been moved to
include/flex.skel.static.

(NOTE TO EPICS SYSTEM MAINTATNERS... the only thing different about this flex 
and the GNU distribution is the Makefile->Imakefile transition, and the 
modification of the skeleton file.  It should be easy enough to start over
again if you wish to remove the imake stuff... just make sure you get one that
has the same skeleton version so you can use our hacked one... or do the diff
game on them.)
