<ul>
  <li>The new architectures <tt>linux-x86_64</tt> and <tt>solaris-sparc64</tt>
    are known to not work yet; do not attempt do use them, although if you need
    either one an offer to help find the problems would be welcomed.</li>
  <li>It is not possible to build a statically linked version of base on
    HP-UX.  If you need this and manage to work out how, please tell us!</li>
  <li>We have had problems with the linux-x86 target running on the Linux
    2.6.10 kernel, but these disappeared with later kernel versions.</li>
